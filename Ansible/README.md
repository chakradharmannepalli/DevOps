# Ansible - Automation Made Simple

---

## üìå What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source IT automation tool that helps automate cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs. It uses a simple, human-readable language (YAML) to describe automation jobs.

- **Powerful Automation:** Automates repetitive tasks efficiently.
- **Extensible:** Supports custom modules, plugins, and integration with other tools.

## üî• Core Concepts

### 1. Ad-Hoc Commands

Ansible ad-hoc commands are simple one-line commands for quick tasks or checks without writing a playbook.

**Example:**  
```bash
ansible all -m ping
ansible webservers -a "uptime"
